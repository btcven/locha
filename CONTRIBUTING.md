## Locha Mesh Contributors 

Many of our original contributors have been doing this work on their own in oppressed countries. We are working on helping them find and use tools like [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) to safely connect to GitHub and add their contributions to help make this technology more open and available to all. We appreciate your patience and support as we transition into a more open project and consolidate all of the great work that has been done outside of GitHub to this point. 

The future is ours, when we work together.
